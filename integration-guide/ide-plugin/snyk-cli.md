# Snyk CLI

Snyk has OS specific binaries that are available for download. Sample Java code implementation for downloading the CLI can be found [here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/snyk-security-scanner-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/io/snyk/jenkins/tools/internal/DownloadService.java).

After the initial installation it is recommended to check weekly for availability of newer CLI versions. Snyk releases updates \(features and stability\) to the CLI quite often, so it is not recommended to skip this step.
