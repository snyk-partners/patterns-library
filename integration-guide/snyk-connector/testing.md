# Testing

Testing your Snyk Connector will require access to the Snyk platform along with a few sample applications imported into your Snyk Environment. The BizDev team at Snyk can provide you with access to a Snyk environment that has a single [group](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004037617-What-s-a-Snyk-group-) and a single [organization](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004037637-What-s-a-Snyk-organization-). You can import the Snyk sample projects to your organization. To configure your GitHub integration in your test environment please see the [Snyk Integration documentation](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004032117-GitHub-integration).

The quickest and easiest way to get your test environment is to sign up for a free [Snyk account.](https://snyk.io/signup) Once you have created your free account, contact the Snyk business development team with the email associated with the account and we will upgrade you to a paid plan for testing.
