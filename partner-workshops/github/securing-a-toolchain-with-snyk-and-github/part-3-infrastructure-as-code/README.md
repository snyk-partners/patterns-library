In part 2, we packaged our application into a container, opening the door for us to deploy it into a container orchestration environment like Kubernetes or OpenShift. While deploying the application is out of scope for this lab, we cover how to ensure deployment manifests, what controls how the application is deployed into these environments, are built securely and conform to best practices.

Part 3 has three Sections, and showcases Snyk Infrastructure as Code. Move on to Section 1 to get started!
