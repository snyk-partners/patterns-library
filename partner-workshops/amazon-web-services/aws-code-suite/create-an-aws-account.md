# Create an AWS account

{% hint style="info" %}
Your account must have the ability to create new IAM roles and scope other IAM permissions. If you already have an AWS account, and have IAM Administrator access, you can skip this page.
{% endhint %}

* If you don't already have an AWS account with Administrator access: [create one now](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/gettingstarted.html#sign-up-for-aws)
* Once you have an AWS account, ensure you are following the remaining workshop steps as an **IAM user** with administrator access to the AWS account: [Create a new IAM user to use for the workshop](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/users$new)
