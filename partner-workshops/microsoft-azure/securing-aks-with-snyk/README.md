# Securing AKS with Snyk

### Welcome

This workshop will provide you with sample patterns and reference architectures for securing [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) workloads running on [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service \(AKS\)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) with [Snyk](https://snyk.io/). We will provide you with step-by-step examples and sample code that will walk you through deployment of supporting infrastructure, sample applications, and configuration of the various Snyk integrations to Microsoft Azure.

### Prerequisites

In order to complete the exercises in this workshop, you will need both a [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) & [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) account.

* [Create](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free) a free Microsoft Azure account.
* [Create](https://snyk.io/login) a free Snyk account.
