# Fix Pull Requests

From the Snyk app, we will go to the **Projects** menu where we can expand each integration and have a holistic view of our project. Here we will select the `package.json` under our Bitbucket repo.

We are able to view additional context for each identified vulnerability in the report. We also have the option to **Open a fix PR** by clicking on the button. Let's do that!

A summary page will appear listing each fix that will be included in your pull request.
