# Module 4

## Background

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/snyk-bitbucket-flow-module-04.png)

Now it's time to put what we have learned in the previous modules to practice. We will go through three steps that will focus on fixing issues in your application source, container image, and Kubernetes configuration.

## Learning objective

In this module, you will leverage Snyk to:

1. Submit a **fix pull request** for the vulnerabilities in your application dependencies
2. Apply **base image upgrade** recommendations to your container image
3. Define **security context** in your Kubernetes manifest

## Let's get started!
