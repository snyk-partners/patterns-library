# Configure Snyk for DevSecOps

## How does Snyk help developers?

Snyk works where developers work. Synk integrates into the development toolchain solutions, like git, to provide automated developer workflows to remediate vulnerabilities and provide seamless integrations. Snyk assists developers in making the right decisions about their open-source vulnerabilities, building secure container images, and writing and validating their infrastructure as code \(IaC\) files to be compliant with company policy.
