# Create a Snyk organization

## Organizations

Organizations in Snyk help users assign configurations for a collection of projects, aggregate information for reporting, etc. Users will have one or more organizations in their environment. 

### Create a new Snyk organization for the workshop

[Open a browser and sign in to your Synk account.](https://app.snyk.io)

To create a new organization, choose the ‘Create’ link in the drop-down in the top navigation. Name the new organization **SpringOne-Workshop** as we will use this name later in our CI/CD pipeline

### Configure preferred organization

Snyk uses organizations to group project results and to generate reports. If you have multiple organizations, please configure your preferred Snyk organization to be springone-workshop for this workshop.

This step simplifies the instructions in the workshop. In your environment, you would provide the organization as part of the configuration.
