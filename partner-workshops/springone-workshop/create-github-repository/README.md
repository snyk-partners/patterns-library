# Create Github Repository

## Getting started with the repo

We forked the famous Spring Petclinic repo from the Spring community to add a Kubernetes directory and a CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions. Later in the workshop, we will configure the GitHub Actions pipeline with your Snyk and Docker Hub keys. We will also deploy the SPC application in a Kubernetes cluster running on the lab VM. For now, let create a copy of this forked SPC repo in your personal GitHub account.

### Workshop Exercises

We will complete the following steps:

1. Clone Spring-Petclinic repo to a personal account.
